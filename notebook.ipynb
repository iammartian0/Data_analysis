Have you made any changes to the data to enable further analysis? Remember to describe what you did for every column in the data. \n\n*Write your description here*\n\nThe intial dataset is with **98** rows and **8** columns as per given description. First thing, I checked for missing values and found in the column '**Cause**'. I switched missing values with string '**Unknown**'. Then I checked datatypes of values in multiple columns and as per instructions converted column 'Claim Amount' to float data type from object type. Then I checked for ranges of numeric values and found that one of the claim has '**-57**' days as 'Time to Claim'. I am treating it as outlier as it is the **only negative value**. Looking at the remaining columns of focus:\n- There are 98 unique case id's.\n- Time to close ranging from 29 to 3591 days.\n- 4 distinct loacations","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\nDescribe what you found in the analysis and how the visualizations answer the customer questions in the project brief. In your description you should:\n- Include at least two different data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of single variables\n- Include at least one data visualization to demonstrate the relationship between two or more variables\n- Describe how your analysis has answered the business questions in the project brief\n\n*Write your description here*\n\n### 1. How does the number of claims differ across locations?\nThe answer can be better explained with the following plot.\n\n![A PIE plot should be here](pie.png)\n\nAmong the four locations, '**SAO LUIS**' has  the highest number of claims and '**NATAL**' has lowest and **FORTALEZA** has almost same percentage.\n### 2. What is the distribution of time to close claims?\n\n![Box plot about the distribution of claim closing time](dclaim.png)\n\nThe plot suggest that we have a skewed distribution of closing time. 75% of claims took around 1150 days to close while the mean closing time is around 841 days. The inter-quartile range is from about 350 days to 1150 days and maximum days to close a claim is 3591 days. This suggests that ,there are some of claims which took more than 2300 days, the upper whisker limit to close. The following figure can explain further distribution across various locations.\n\n![Plot about various location](distloc.png)\n\nAll of the locations,except 'SAO LUIS' have values after their uppper whisker limit which suggests that each location have claims which took longer to close than their normal closing time. The **wide spread of 'SAO LUIS' suggests that it has largest variation** in closing time it took for the legal team to process the claims. But it can be related to the fact that SAO LUIS having highest number of the claims. Likewise, location 'NATAL' has less spread suggesting it has less variation and it's upper whisker limit is much less compared to other locations suggesting its normal closing time is less compared to others. And the scenerio of distribution of other two locations is in between 'SAO LUIS' and 'NATAL'.\n### 3. How does the average time to close claims differ by location?\nThe mean vlaues are generally similar to original distribution which suggests that 'SAO LUIS' has largest mean and 'NATAL' has lowest mean. After performing mean aggregation over the 'Time of Close' column, I am able to plot the following figure.\n\n![Scatter plot](mean.png)\n\nI set size of points to their mean of claim closing times. From the plot, we can conclude that distribution of closing time across different locations is reflecting their corresponding mean values. The mean value of 'SAO LUIS' is largest and almost double of 'NATAL'. Even though 'NATAL' and 'FORTALEZA' have closer percent of number of claims, their mean claim closing times are noticibly far to each other. 'RECIFE' has second highest mean value.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric, have you included everything that will be graded?\n-  Head back to the [Certification Dashboard](https://app.datacamp.com/certification) to submit your practical exam","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"f635131a-00f8-44dd-b610-509db41c1154","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
